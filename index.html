				<h2>The Genesis</h2>
				<p>It all began when Max Osiris and Robness were denegrated by collectors on SuperRare for creating "trash art." They were soon banned from their platform and their art censored as a result. And many artists and collectors were appaled by the behavior of the platform and quickly we began to own the term "trashart" and build a community around it.</p>

				<h2>The Movement</h2>
				<p>It's the first and only digitally native art movement at the time of this writing. The movement is centered around the themes of gatekeeping, censorship, copyleft, and onboarding new artists into the NFT space. Instead of a centralized club or a society, we tend to think of the movment as a decentralized conversation. People from all walks of life and beliefs came together to adopt the ethos of openess and sharing knowledge to help onboard as many people as possible.</p>

				<h2>The Meme</h2>
				<p>Robness' 64-gallon Toter became the memetic symbol of the movement. Since it's inception, it has spawned countless remixes, parodies, and homages over the last year. If you see an NFT featuring a garbage receptical of some kind, it's not a coincidence. It's just trashart. Trashart memes are not only toters these days. It has spread spread to include other memetic themes including potatoes, saucy nugs, pubes, and rats

				<h2>The Aesthetic</h2>
				<p>A loose, but consistent style has develped over time. You often hear people say, "I can't tell you what trashart is, but you know when you see it." However, it can be described as a combination of glitchart, remix, digital painting, and collage used in conjunction with the art snthesizer product, Photomosh. Though not a requirement, a lot of trash art has been moshed.</p>
